# Record audio while speech recognizing with iflyMSC.framework
An iOS simple demo for recording audio while speech recognizing with iflyMSC.framework

This project shows how to use iflyMSC.framework components to implement speech recognizing and record audio at the same time, and convert the pcm audio stream to audio data, so that save a *.wav in the mobile sandbox at the end.
